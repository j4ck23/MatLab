% ------------ Question Text --------------------------------------------
% To calibrate its sensors, the robot needs to know the normal to the plane where the object is contained, when ùë°=0, 
% and then align it with the plane (ùëß,ùë¶). To do so:
% a. The students have to write a program to find the normal vector, and to plot it as an arrow. [10pts]
% b. The students have to write a program to find the angle which is needed to rotate the model at ùë°=0, 
% until it will be contained within the plane (ùëß,ùë¶) [10pts]
% c. The students have to rotate the model, to obtain a new collection of points which will be contained in the plane (ùëß,ùë¶) [15pts]

load('Assessment1Data.mat') %this load into the workspace 2 matrices, with filtered and unfiltered (raw) data. The structure is reported in the text.
% Consider that the data structure is the  following: in the first column you have the time of the data, 
% then from column 2 to colum 19, you have the x, y and z position of 6 different markers, therefore this is a row of the matrix:
% [time x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3 x4 y4 z4 x5 y5 z5]
% note that marker x0,y0,z0 is the proximal one, and x5,y5,z5 is the distal one.
