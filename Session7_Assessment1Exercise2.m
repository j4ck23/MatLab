% ------------ Question Text --------------------------------------------
%Some objects might be affected by external conditions, and a set of tri-dimensional coordinates 洧녷(洧노)=(洧논(洧노),洧녽(洧노),洧녾(洧노)) 
% of one moving object will be presented to the students.
%a. The students have to implement a program to plot the tri-dimensional shape at the beginning of the movement, 洧노=0, 
% and then to select the most appropriate function to model the physical object. [15pts]
%By considering that the object is oscillating, the robot can pick it only when the velocity is close to zero:
%b. The students have to implement a program to identify the moment, 洧노洧녷, which is optimal to perform the picking action. [15pts]
%To evaluate if the robotic arm has enough workspace to collect the object, you can estimate the volume under the object while it moves:
% original matrix M, reported here for your convenience.
%c. The students have to write a program to calculate the volume under the object, during its full movement [10pts]

% ------------ Exercise Starts --------------------------------------------
load('Assessment1Data.mat') %this load into the workspace 2 matrices, with filtered and unfiltered (raw) data. The structure is reported in the text.
% Consider that the data structure is the  following: in the first column you have the time of the data, 
% then from column 2 to colum 19, you have the x, y and z position of 6 different markers, therefore this is a row of the matrix:
% [time x0 y0 z0 x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3 x4 y4 z4 x5 y5 z5]
% note that marker x0,y0,z0 is the proximal one, and x5,y5,z5 is the distal one.

% to do this i used the trapz function, this function caculates the
% integral by using the trapezoidal method, this involes breaking the area
% down in to trapezoids to compute the area, i then do this for all the
% columns minus 2,3 and 4 as they are all zeros.
