% Assign to variables "a", "b" and "c" three different, 
% arbitrary values
% --------- Insert your code here ----------------------

% ------------------------------------------------------
% consider the following sequence of operations: 

a = a + b; %operation 1
c = a - b; %operation 2
b = b * c; %operation 3

d = a^b;
% Check what is the value assigned to "d". Now, mix the operations swapping
% their order, and print again "d". Is the value changed? Can you explain
% why?
