% Consider the flow chart to assign variables and to do operations on them.
% Use this Matlab script file to assign to variables "a", "b" and "c" three different, 
% arbitrary values. Do not print the result on the command window;
% you have to check the result on the workspace panel. (Hint: to
% suppress the output, use the semi-column)
% --------- Insert your code here ----------------------
a = 1;
b = 2;
c = 3;
% ------------------------------------------------------
% sum, subtract, multipy and divide them, the operation to other variables,
% with names of your choice.

% ------------------------------------------------------
% Now, use the operator "^" to elevate "a" to the power of 0, "b" to the
% power of 1, and "c" to the power of 2. (Hint: the syntax for "a to the
% power of b is, result = a^b;)
